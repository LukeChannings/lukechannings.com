<Addendum>
  The design for Safari 15 has been very controvercial, and has changed
  significantly since the beta that this article was based on Sadly, one of the
  casualties of the evolving design was the main thrust of this article:{" "}
  <code>env(safe-area-inset-bottom)</code> is no longer dynamically the height
  of the address bar in the final release.
  <br />
</Addendum>

**TL;DR**: [No](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betteridge's_law_of_headlines), ~~but if you subtract `env(safe-area-inset-bottom)` from `100vh` you'll get what you want~~.

Safari 15's UI is a radical departure from the previous version &mdash; and from web browsers in general &mdash; but does it fix the viewport height problem?

## What is the viewport height problem again?

Mobile Safari has had problems related to `100vh` not behaving like web developers expect[^1] [^2] pretty much since the beginning.
The main crux of the issue is that Mobile Safari's UI Chrome shrinks when you scroll, and expands again when you activate it.
That means `100vh` ("100% the height of the viewport") can't be a static number.

Let's start by understanding the definition of the `vh` unit [^3]:

> `vh` is defined as `Equal to 1% of the height of the initial containing block`.
>
> &mdash; <cite>[Anthony Frehner](https://twitter.com/aahfrena)</cite>

And here's the best explanation of the `100vh` issues in Mobile Safari that I've seen so far,

> The core issue is that mobile browsers (I’m looking at you, Chrome and Safari) have a “helpful” feature where the address bar is sometimes visible and sometimes hidden, changing the visible size of the viewport.
>
> Rather than adjusting the height of `100vh` to be the visible portion of the screen as the viewport height changes, these browsers instead have `100vh` set to the height of the browser with the address bar hidden.
>
> The result is that the bottom portion of the screen will be cut off when the address bar is visible, thus defeating the purpose of `100vh` to begin with.
>
> &mdash; <cite>[David Chanin](https://chanind.github.io/about/), [Avoid 100vh On Mobile Web](https://chanind.github.io/javascript/2019/09/28/avoid-100vh-on-mobile-web.html)</cite>

## Let's put this new Safari to the test

I have [a simple HTML page](https://gist.github.com/LukeChannings/efdd456bccc3ee1459eacc663e9abc24) based on the example given in David's article.
It has a header at the top and a button at the bottom, all wrapped in a `100vh` container.

<div className="image-group-figure">
  <figure>
    <img
      src={ios14ChromeUrl}
      width="563"
      height="1219"
      decoding="async"
      loading="lazy"
      alt="an image showing the aforementioned button hidden below the bottom UI controls in iOS 14's Mobile Safari"
    />
    <figcaption>Safari 14 with Chrome active</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <figure>
    <img
      src={ios15ChromeUrl}
      width="563"
      height="1219"
      decoding="async"
      loading="lazy"
      alt="an image showing the button being partially covered by the new floating address bar in iOS 15's Mobile Safari"
    />
    <figcaption>Safari 15 with Chrome active</figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

Safari's new floating address bar is displayed above our test button,
which is more-or-less exactly the same behaviour as iOS 14.

So - Safari 15 does not change the behavour of `100vh` 😢.

### So what's the solution then?

It makes sense to me that the WebKit team wouldn't change the behaviour of the viewport unit, it's already well defined.

Do you remember when Apple introduced `env()` and `safe-area-inset` so
that web developers could avoid their content being shown behind the notch[^4]?

Well in Safari 14, `safe-area-inset-bottom` is `0px` whether the UI chrome is active or inactive,
which is something that has annoyed me for a while.

`safe-area-inset-bottom` is `0px` when the UI chrome is inactive in Safari 15 on iOS,
and then **the height of the collapsed chrome minus the height of the expanded chrome** when the bar is expanded.

That means that to get a button to float at the bottom of the page, always above the UI Chrome, all you have to do is use `calc(100vh - env(safe-area-inset-bottom))`.

<div className="image-group-figure">
  <figure>
    <video
      src={ios14SafeAreaInsetBottomUrl}
      width="886"
      height="1920"
      playsinline
      loop
      muted
      autoplay
      preload
    ></video>
    <figcaption>
      Safari 14 with <strong>100vh - safe-area-inset-bottom</strong>
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
  <figure>
    <video
      src={ios15SafeAreaInsetBottomUrl}
      width="886"
      height="1920"
      playsinline
      loop
      muted
      autoplay
      preload
    ></video>
    <figcaption>
      Safari 15 with <strong>100vh - safe-area-inset-bottom</strong>
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

## Wrapping up

So not only does `safe-area-inset-bottom` work in Safari 15, **it's animated**!

I've been hoping that something to remedy the viewport height bug was coming since
[Jen Simmons](https://jensimmons.com) (who joined the Safari / WebKit team in June 2020) was asking for feedback regarding viewport
height issues.

    Hey everyone who’s been frustrated that VH units in CSS don’t do what you
    need… can you describe your usecase? What layout are you creating? With
    which layout mechanism? What do you need? Screenshots &amp; sample code
    appreciated.
