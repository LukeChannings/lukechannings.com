# Why I prefer HSL to RGB

Outline:

- Background: RGB and how I've been thinking about colours
- Another way to think about colours
- Argument: HSL is easier to work with than RGB, you're just used to RGB
- Argument: Switching to HSL is worthwhile
  - Example: Brightening components on hover
  - Example: Theming a UI with a key colour
  - Example: Generating a random colour but still controlling the brightness / saturation

## Background: RGB and how I've been thinking about colours

Turn your mind back to when you first learned colours in CSS - whether it was yesterday or 20 years ago - and think about what you learned.

Chances are that your first introduction to CSS Colours was the hex syntax[^1]: `#ff0000` red, `#00ff00` green, `#0000ff` blue.
You learn that mixing different amounts of red, green, and blue light can create any colour, and that's how you start to think about colours in CSS.

When you learn RGB, you can learn that higher numbers make the colour lighter, and lower numbers make the colour darker, but there is no intuition for what colour `#800020` will come out as (burgundy).

Another way to think about colours

With RGB, we think of a colour as mixing red, green, and blue, kinda like painting. But there's another way to think about colours that we've been using this whole time: the colour circle.

<!-- 
<style>
  .boxes {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: row;
    gap: 20px;
  }

  .box {
    width: 100px;
    height: 100px;
    background-color: hsl(
      var(--hue, 180),
      var(--saturation, 50%),
      var(--brightness, 50%)
    );
  }
</style>

<fieldset>
<label>
  Hue
  <input
    type="range"
    oninput="javascript:boxes.style.setProperty('--hue', event.target.value)"
    min="0"
    max="360"
    value="180"
  />
</label>

<label>
  Brightness
  <input
    type="range"
    oninput="javascript:boxes.style.setProperty('--brightness', event.target.value + '%')"
    min="0"
    max="100"
    value="50"
  />
</label>
</fieldset>
<div class="boxes" id="boxes">
  <script>
    for (let i = 0; i < 10; i += 1) {
      document.write(`<div class="box" style="--saturation: ${i * 10}%"></div>`)
    }
  </script>
</div> -->

[^1]: I'm only talking about complete systems for representing any colour, I know you probably learned colour names first.
